# Cyan Skillfish GPU governor
GPU governor for the AMD Cyan Skillfish APU.
Continously maintains a target frequency, and adjusts the actual GPU frequency when the deviation is too great.
If the CPU is continously busy for too long, ramps up the target frequency rapidly.

Takes a TOML config file path as its only argument.
Keys are:
* `timing`
  * `intervals`: in Âµs
    * `sample`: how often to sample GPU load
      (it's a single bit, so needs to be sampled more often than you'd think)
    * `adjust`: how often to consider adjusting the frequency
    * `finetune` how long since the last adjustment to consider making a fine-tuning adjustment
  * `burst-samples`: while the GPU has been busy for this many samples in a row,
    enter "burst mode", increasing the frequency at the `timing.ramp_rates.burst` rate.
    Set to 0 to disable burst mode.
  * `ramp_rates`: how quickly to increase/decrease GPU frequency, in MHz/ms
    * `normal`: ramp rate for normal adjustments
    * `burst`: ramp rate in burst mode
* `frequency-thresholds`: in MHz
  * `adjust`: how large a proposed adjustment must be to actually be carried out
  * `finetune`: how large a fine-tuning adjustment must be to be actually carried out
* `load-target`: as a fraction
  * `upper`: GPU load above which target frequency is increased
  * `lower`: GPU load below which target frequency is decreased
* `safe-points`: known safe/stable power points, array of tables with two keys:
  * `frequency`: GPU frequency in MHz
  * `voltage`: GPU supply voltage in mV
